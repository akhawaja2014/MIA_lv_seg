## What this Project is about?
Left Ventricle is an integral part of the heart. It pumps blood into the body. Cardiovascular diseases are quite common in modern world. The health of the heart can be studied using left ventricle. Most of the heart diseases can be diagnosed by retrieving important information from systole and diastole operations of heart via effective medical imaging analysis of Left Ventricle (LV). The segmentation of Left Ventricle plays an important role in retrieving the ejection fraction (a parameter which indicates the heartâ€™s health). Since Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are noisy and not really perfect, scientific community is always curious to find more efficient, reliable, robust and more accurate segmentation methods to calculate ejection fraction.
 In this project, a combination of smoothing algorithm, K-means algorithm and border following algorithm is implemented.

## Anatomy of Heart
The heart is made up of four chambers: two upper chambers known as the left atrium and right atrium and two lower chambers called the left and right ventricles. These are shown in following figure.
